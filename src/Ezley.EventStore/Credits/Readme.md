Thank you to Sander Molenkamp for sharing the code 
https://github.com/amolenk/CosmosEventSourcing, 
my starting point for EventSourcing, and for this project.

Sander was kind enough to share his code under the 
MIT license. I strongly suggest you watch his
video on EventSourcing at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UejwRlmV6E4. It was
a huge help to me.

Thank you,

Marc Talcott
